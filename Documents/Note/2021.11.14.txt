Topics
1. Programming Language --> We have Python (Tensorflow) / MATLAB 
2. Meeting --> According to issues
3. Find People --> 10 People
4. How do we collect the data?

Data we are getting from RP
1.) Voltage
2.) timestamp
3.) FFT 
4.) Classified result as 0 or 1 (person or not)
5.) Etc.

Criteria for data collection
1.) Take photo -> record#1 (for ex)
2.) Let the person in/out of the car --> start/stop recording
3.) Summer wear (1 person -> 1 cloth)
4.) 1 Person --> sit 2s --> 20 measurements --> empty seat 2s --> 20 measurements   = 40 measurements
    100 times x 40 = 4000 measurements.
    10 persons = 40,000 measurements.
5.) Fix people and wears. 
6.) If possible, record more than 10 people.
7.) Record whatever possible at the collection time. (for ex sensor pos.)

10 measurement => 1s
40000          => 4000s

Questions 
1.) Do we have another sensor at car? --> Email to Mr.Umansky
2.) Do we have enough time for data collection? --> Email to Mr.Umansky 
3.) The RP Board does not working --> Email to Mr.Umansky 
4.) 4th person issue --> Email to Prof. Nauth

Person --> Seat --> measurement 2s

Measuring 1s --> Sensor measures 10/s --> 10 Measurements (10 Scans) --> ADC--> 10x16384 


(
    AD Sampling rate = 1,95 MHz 1,95M [sampling/s] --> sampling time [approx.] 0.5 microsec. 
    buffer length 16384 --> 16374 x 0.5 microsec. --> approx 8ms. signal length
    12 bit ADC Voltage 

    We will have 16384 voltage at the time length 8ms length

    we have to divide time length by two for Round trip time, since it is a reflection from ultrasonic.

    we have to calculate the time for reflection too.

    we get only 1 RED Pitaya board.

    40 KHz ultrasonic wave in air

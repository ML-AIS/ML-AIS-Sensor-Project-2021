# Project 1: Parameter setting and reliability test of a sensor system for person detection in a car wearing summer wear.

Classification of person sitting in a car wearing summer wear using Red Pitaya with Ultrasonic Sensor

## Milestone

The table below shows milestones, which we have to achieve. There maybe some changes, we will have to update it accordingly.

## Ideas about Report above Tasks

### 1.  Reports
    1.  Basic Theories about Sensor, Red Pitaya (Gateway Device), Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT), Sampling Frequency, etc

    2.  Evaluation from exist application. How does it behave in different situations. Shows the evaluation results (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, TPR, FPR, TNR, FNR) and Confusion matrices and graphs. Aso different threshold settings. 

    3.  Developement of our classification model.

    4.  Comparison between the prev. and the new classification model.

    5.  Conclusion.

    ...


### 2.  Classification Model Development 
    1.  Use our existed model from Computational Intelligence Subj.
    2.  Adjust and modifiy the model.
